### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



I have been actively working in the programming field for a year.
I always aim for the best and the most improvable. I always take firm steps forward on this path and take steps passionately and enthusiastically by learning more about software.
I develop interactive user interfaces using HTML, CSS, BOOTSRAP and SCSS. 
I have a passion for developing functional web applications that are always open to development. I can work both individually and as part of a team with high motivation.
I look forward to working with teams with passion and enthusiasm in open and challenging projects.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, SCSS, SASS
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JAVASCRÄ°PT
